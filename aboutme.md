Hello everyone! My name is Adrien but people know me for under my nickname "BlackRaven".  I am currently a high school student. I love reverse engineering and networks, but I'm quite curious about everything.

I also really like doing CTFs.  But I also do some on my side on [Root-me](https://www.root-me.org/BlackRaven-489765), [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com) and [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/).

If you would like to discuss cybersecurity or any of the articles / writeups that I have written, feel free to DM via Discord or Twitter !
