Hello ! My name is Adrien, or if you prefer, BlackRaven, and I'm into cybersecurity since 2021.

I'm currently learning reverse, but I like everything, except web of course.

### What will you find here ?

You'll find some writeups here about CTFs. And, of course, some technical articles about vulnerabilities, etc. Feel free to DM !
